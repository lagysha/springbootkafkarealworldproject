### Spring Boot and Kafka Real World Project

- ✅ Docker + Kafka and Spring Boot
- ✅ Kafka producer which reads real-time stream data from the Wikimedia and then it writes that data to the Kafka broker
- ✅ Kafka consumer which consumes the real-time stream data from the Kafka broker and then it writes to the database
- ✅ Real-world project is a best use case to demonstrate the usage of Apache Kafka, because basically, we use Apache Kafka to deal with a large amount of data
- ✅ So whenever a user makes a change in the Wikimedia that the entry will be stored as an event in the Wikimedia server and by using this REST API, we can fetch all the users who made recent changes to the Wikimedia
